This is a straightforward survey application developed in React.js, comprising three main components:

CreateSurvey:
This component manages the creation of surveys. Initially, the right side of the page displays inputs for the title and description.
Below these inputs are two buttons: one for creating the survey and the other for resetting the entire survey form.
On the right side, there is a box where a list of questions will be displayed once added.
Additionally, there is a button to open a modal where users can add questions to the survey.
Initially, the create survey button is disabled until a title, description, and at least one question are added.
In the question modal, users have two options: they can add questions and their options, or they can add questions with an input field for users to write their own answers.
While there are many potential features to enhance this survey creation form, I've kept it minimal for assessment purposes.
Upon successfully creating a survey and clicking the button, a toast message will appear indicating the successful creation of the survey, and the user will be navigated to the next screen.


SurveyList:
The SurveyList component displays surveys in a list format, showing their titles.
By clicking on a survey title, a modal will open displaying all the survey questions and options.
Users are required to answer all the questions and submit their responses.
Upon submission, a toast message will appear indicating the response successful submitted, users will be directed to the next screen.


History:
The History screen displays a table of user responses, along with the date and time of submission.
By clicking "view response," a modal will open allowing users to review all their responses from previous survey submissions.


This survey app flow is intentionally kept simple for assessment purposes, although it could be made more efficient and comprehensive.

I have also written test cases for each component, which can be executed by running the command npm test.
